# Catan-AI

<i>Developed by Giacomo Ettore Rocco, Alessandro Nuzzi and Riccardo Zulla</i>

### Contents
- Implementation of Settlers Of Catan game
- Implementation of game-playing agent with AI technologies



### Game example

<b>1 pure ai agent</b> versus <b>3 priority agents</b> (hard-coded agents)

In this example the red player's moves are choosen by the AI agent.

### Conclusions

This implementation employs a supervised approach to train a game-playing agent to score the available moves and choose the best one.

The game of Settlers of Catan has a stochastic nature that prevents us from reaching high performances and stability. For this reason, the implementation of a probabilistic approach using reinforcement learning techniques could be the next step in this project.
